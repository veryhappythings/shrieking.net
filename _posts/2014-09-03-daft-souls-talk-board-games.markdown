Hello! Just wanted to drop in this episode of a podcast that I rather like, Daft Souls. It's a video games podcast but in this episode they kick off with a chat about board game [Dead of Winter](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/150376/dead-winter-crossroads-game).

They start with it, so just get listening, you don't need to skip ahead.

They touch a little on the topic of my last blog post here: while video games often provide a good story, board games provide a framework of rules and narrative moments which allow you to create your own stories.
