I’ve been using Spotify for a long time. I’m not 100% sure when I started using it, but it launched in 2008 and when I gave out invites to my friends, one of them took a 2 character username, so I guess it must have been 2008 or 2009. I have been using playlists from the start - I even have collaborative playlists from before they stored the date in which each song was added. Deep in all of this, there are some real gems, so I thought I’d dive through them and dig some up.

At the top of my playlists I have Spotify’s Discover Weekly, which is always good for new music hunting, and my [Starred](https://open.spotify.com/user/puresock/playlist/3jS4WLAt4lz4HiymkverMr) playlist. Starring songs went away for quite sensible reasons sometime after 2013, but my starred songs still represent an excellent selection of my favourite music.

After that, everything’s in folders. I remember when playlist folders arrived in Spotify - it was a very, very good day.

I have an “offline” folder that I rotate things through, to make it easy to track them on my phone and quickly download them. A lot of stuff rolls through here, depending on my mood, but right now, my [Holiday](https://open.spotify.com/user/puresock/playlist/6ZLJRdR3paOdsdh0dgddAv) mix is all that’s in there worth mentioning.

My next folder is entitled “Things I Made”. This folder contains all my timeless playlists, ranging from a braindump of every bit of music that I find helps me be [productive](https://open.spotify.com/user/puresock/playlist/0WDvckY49peNdO2DOEVDhM) to quite carefully built mixtapes like [Maccy’s Lovely Summer](https://open.spotify.com/user/puresock/playlist/7ddhIdD9v0i3IA44src77N) and [Fun Spring Stuff](https://open.spotify.com/user/puresock/playlist/6h2UKOy8SyWaQ0pOtZzYR5). I also have a few gems like this [collation of albums from a Reddit thread listing classic albums from the past 10 years](https://open.spotify.com/user/puresock/playlist/4nxjOyXVuXULTvQIjZ5dvH).
