This is part 2 of a journey through my Spotify profile. If you haven’t, check out [part 1](http://www.shrieking.net/a-dig-through-my-spotify-profile-part-1/).

Moving on, I have a folder of collaborative playlists. I can’t link any of these, as they’re semi-private, but among them I have Our Favourite Songs, which a group of us started some time prior to 2010. I have no idea how many people have looked at it over the years. We add things to it now and then. It is now 40 hours long, containing 619 songs. The quality of songs on there is extremely variable. I also have three related playlists from my friend Darren, who, upset at the lack of Boards of Canada on Spotify (mercifully rectified today), asked for our help in finding music that is “Like Boards of Canada”, “Not Quite Like Boards of Canada”, and “Not Like Boards of Canada”. They remain an excellent resource.

After that comes the “Other People” folder, a home for playlists made by other people. Here I collect things that people have sent me as well as a few things like a playlist from BBC 6 Music’s [Anthems](https://open.spotify.com/user/puresock/playlist/6ETM5haLQ7I3TvJIuN0r97) show. Movie soundtracks, such as [10 Things I Hate About You](https://open.spotify.com/user/harradaemonic/playlist/625KQoeAo3QAxafraWdRXi) and [Human Traffic](https://open.spotify.com/user/markcrosby/playlist/1c1wB9twUHiqtXMbCopEhy) live here, as does [Ryan Davis’s](http://www.giantbomb.com/ryan-davis/3040-93335/) [Realest Summerjams](https://open.spotify.com/user/taswell/playlist/26eEZkxxU2KzKLmtVDF8he).

I have a folder called Albums, which is largely redundant now that Spotify keeps better track of albums you listen to. Not much to report here, but I’m going to link you to Envy’s [Set Yourself on Fire](https://open.spotify.com/album/0Pqk78gcHfHynYyPXq3fCQ), because it’s good and you should listen to it, and Gescom’s [Mini Disc](https://open.spotify.com/album/1LxGODGLwoHaZYyXSgEQNP), because it’s a fascinating [concept album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minidisc_(album)) that you’ve probably never heard of.

Can you believe that I'm not finished yet? More in part 3.
