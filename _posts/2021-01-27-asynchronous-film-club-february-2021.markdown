[Film Club in Lockdown 2](https://www.shrieking.net/lockdown-film-club-november-2020/) was a lot of fun, and we're now in Lockdown 3 so it's time to do it again. As before, no scheduled Zoom meets (but don't let me stop you if that's your jam) and nothing more than suggestions of interesting things to watch.

The theme this time is "optimism", which is a tricky theme. I've tried to pick some optimistic films, but at very least I think they fit into the category of "feel good". Hopefully they manage to bring some joy to your locked down lives.

If these films don't work for you, I've stuck a list of other ideas at the bottom.

### The Princess Bride

1st February - 7th February

> In this enchantingly cracked fairy tale, the beautiful Princess Buttercup and the dashing Westley must overcome staggering odds to find happiness amid six-fingered swordsmen, murderous princes, Sicilians and rodents of unusual size. But even death can't stop these true lovebirds from triumphing.

### Chef

8th February - 14 February

> When Chef Carl Casper suddenly quits his job at a prominent Los Angeles restaurant after refusing to compromise his creative integrity for its controlling owner, he is left to figure out what's next. Finding himself in Miami, he teams up with his ex-wife, his friend and his son to launch a food truck. Taking to the road, Chef Carl goes back to his roots to reignite his passion for the kitchen -- and zest for life and love.

### The Kings of Summer

15 February - 21 February

> Joe Toy, on the verge of adolescence, finds himself increasingly frustrated by his single father, Frank's attempts to manage his life. Declaring his freedom once and for all, he escapes to a clearing in the woods with his best friend, Patrick, and a strange kid named Biaggio. He announces that they are going to build a house there, free from responsibility and parents. Once their makeshift abode is finished, the three young men find themselves masters of their own destiny, alone in the woods.

### Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse

22 February - 28 February

> Miles Morales is juggling his life between being a high school student and being Spider-Man. However, when Wilson "Kingpin" Fisk uses a super collider, another Spider-Man from another dimension, Peter Parker, accidentally winds up in Miles' dimension. As Peter trains Miles to become a better Spider-Man, they are soon joined by four other Spider-Men from across the "Spider-Verse". As all these clashing dimensions start to tear Brooklyn apart, Miles must help the others stop Fisk and return everyone to their own dimensions.
