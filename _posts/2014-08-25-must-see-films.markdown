After a discussion about films a few months ago, in which it was revealed that I hadn’t seen The Usual Suspects (the situation has now been rectified, don’t panic), Charlie sent me a list of his office’s Must See Films. The creation of the list ran as follows: any time someone in the office hadn’t seen a film, if one of the others was morally outraged by the omission, it went on the list. They kept it within a certain number of years, and there were a few other parameters that kept some classics out of the list, but they ended up with 48 movies. It’s not perfect, but it’s an excellent starter guide for cinema. If you’ve ever not got a movie reference, it’s probably in one of these films.

At the time of writing, I’ve watched 75% of them.

Compiling a list like this is pretty difficult. It’s hard to know what “relevant”, “important”, and “must-see” really mean. What I like about this list is that it’s been built over time by a couple of people who talk about movies a lot - they just listed the movies that they talked about as they went along. It’s a little piece of a workplace’s culture, captured.
