Hello, I'm Mac. I'm 36. I live in Oxfordshire with my wife and daughter. I've been blogging for about 20 years in total, with shrieking.net occupying 13 years of those, and I'm working to get the archives back online, when I have time. Over those years, I've completed a degree in computer science and traveled around the world. It's been alright.

I have too many hobbies and I don't writing about any one topic non-stop, so this blog is about everything, but mainly video games and board games, because I do those most. I also write fiction, so that'll be in there a bit too. I like cooking but rarely have something to say about it.
