It's lockdown time again in the UK, which is making me a bit sad, and I want to do something to alleviate the pain. I don't have a lot of time or energy, and nor do any of my friends, so it has to be something simple. For my birthday this year, my wife made me a schedule of heist films to watch week on week, and I absolutely loved it, so I thought I'd do the same for lockdown and make it public. I'd pick a theme and put together a list of 4 films, one a week, based around it. Everyone's busy, so there's no scheduled viewing, no scheduled discussion: just watch the film, if you like, and talk about it, if you like.

I wanted to put something together that would please everyone, and pick films that would be easy to rent or watch for free, but I don't have the time or energy to do either, so I've just picked a bunch of movies I want to watch. If you like this and you'd like me to make something more accessible in future, then let me know!

So, the theme is **"films from female directors which probably suffered in some fashion due to lockdown, are fun, and not depressing"**. Catchy, huh?

Here are the films, plus a load of links related to each. If you watch them, let me know on Twitter or in the comments! I'd love to know what you think.
